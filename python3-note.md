# Introduction

If you search for "Python Tutorial" on Google, you will get about 695 million results. Among them, one tutorial stands out as a reliable and authoritative source - it is the official tutorial of the Python programming language, written by its creator Guido Van Rossum. You can find it here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. This tutorial is based on the most widely used Python distribution, [CPython](https://www.python.org/), which you can download from https://www.python.org/. There are also other Python distributions, such as [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) and [Python for .NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/), but they are less popular. 

Python is a popular scripting language, even though it has plenty of technical limitations common to all scripting languages described in the section of this document  [C++ Technical Note / Downsides of Interpretable Languages](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#downsides-of-interpretable-languages), and it lacks an official [ISO/IEEE](https://www.iso.org) standard. 

You can check its popularity in this world from these sources:

* The [Tiobe-Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), which ranks programming languages by their popularity on their own metrics.
* The [Google-Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,%2Fm%2F0jgqg,C%23,%2Fm%2F07sbkfb,BASH&hl=r), which shows the relative interest in different topics over time in society.

With this note, the authors have several objectives:

* To explain some technical details about certain language features. This can be a useful resource for those who found the Official Python Tutorial too complex or confusing. 
* This can also help to fill in the gaps in one's understanding of the subject.
* Give a brief overview of various tools
* Provide a bridge from system-aware people to Python, as from Python to system-aware mentality.

## What is Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpretable scripting language. Python was designed originally only as a replacement for Bash, which has been described in that [Blog Post](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpython-history.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F01%2Fpersonal-history-part-1-cwi.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1v3C4KHiJtBbG4NYVY2o__lMchCNVKQGe2ozoI-gcxnwCYNvcdxzD_sHU&h=AT1quzeQEvwmfgFXMnWscdzCzWIJrbgoyQKX22c6w2yzVSaUt9LBMdrL66UgpJaz3rh_-BLBa8FVu3sdV_NzuiuSTU4XPZ5zADu4wGoASMxLcRR-n7Emwogq664lszQUbTZM&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT3TC-zKWleGu9UDUQg6mUKEWZ-El56OnANy8jfnUXLhGPAIHIfrXp6ZVEhtbJztlbUu_3OhD9sRJ7JA_F3ETiL3BsR0dKi58KfhLRwPsHtyRauqYQXDGtxnIeFWRyAxyop0WlHBapKPdoYnVar9DUy3pudNCdWdZ1c4wlxvNA3qoA) written by original author:

> "...My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need for a higher-level language in the Amoeba project. I realized that the development of system administration utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these in the Bourne shell wouldn't work for a variety of reasons. The most important one was that as a distributed micro-kernel system with a radically new design, Amoeba's primitive operations were very different (and finer-grain) than the traditional primitive operations available in the Bourne shell. So there was a need for a language that would "bridge the gap between C and the shell..." - [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).

The most common implementation of the Python interpreter is CPython. It is named CPython because it is written in C/C++. Unlike some other languages, Python does not have an official standard. The only available resources are:

* Language reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/
* Source code of Python interpreter: https://github.com/python/cpython

Python (and any interpreter) parses the program's text (source code) line by line (that is represented or in text form or extremely high-level instructions). Even though Python is interpreted, internally the commands are translated into [Python Virtual Machine](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-machine) before execution. If you want to see what the commands look like, you can use the [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis) module to help you with that:

```python
import dis
def f(x):
    xmy = xmy + 1
    return xmy

dis.dis(f)
```

Documentation: [dis - Disassembler for Python bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html?highlight=dis#module-dis).

## Where to Learn About Python Officially

There are several resources about the subject:

1. There is a book written by Guido van Rossum (the original author of that language).  Today it has been converted into a pretty big tutorial and it not named as a book: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/

2. Python Language Reference: https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/index.html. For example, this is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-callable-objects) to the detailed description of different built-in functions for user-defined classes are here. 

3. Python Interpreter is distributed with various standard modules called Python Standard Library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html. For example, this a [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) to documentation that described Standard Types.

4. CPython interpreter website contains full text search over Python documentation. You can use this utility both in terms of learning and both in terms of finding details: https://docs.python.org/3/search.html

5. The syntax of most Programming Languages is typically described with Backus Naur forms for Context-Free-Grammars (CFG). These grammar rules can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html

6. If you really need to understand how some built-in type is implemented you more likely need to go to the level of a source code of Python interpreter: https://github.com/python/cpython

Finally please take a look into materials from [references](#references) section of this document. It contains short bibliography, which can also be useful.

# Backgrounds

## How Typical Compute Device is Working

It's important to understand that computational devices do not execute code in Java, C#, Matlab, or Python. Computers can not do it. The real computation devices execute binary code compiled in the form of Instruction Set Architecture(ISA). 

A simplified compute CPU device has computation cores that execute arithmetic operations via reading arguments and writing results memory. Memory provides the storage of input and output results.
The control unit in the CPU controls the execution and operation of Electrical Components (developed by Electrical Engineers). Finer details about how computers are working can be obtained from *System Architecture*, *Performace Engineering* courses and books.

## Programming Languages Taxonomy

There are a lot of programming languages these days. One way to analyze programming languages is from the angle of the implemented type system:

* **Static Type System** - statically typed system languages are those in which type checking is done at compile time.
* **Dynamic Type System** - dynamically typed languages are those in which type checking is done at runtime (execution time).
* **Strong Type System** or **Strong Type safety** - implicit type casting is prohibited
* **Weak Type System** or **Weak Type safety** - implicit type casting is allowed.

C and C++ have a *Strong Static Type System*. Examples of Languages with *Weak Type System* are JavaScript and Perl.

Ruby and Python have a *Strong Dynamic Type System*. This means that types are inferred at runtime (dynamic type system), but implicit conversions between types are not allowed (strong type system).

## What is Object Orientated Programming (OOP)

 Object-Orientated-Programming requires some special way to organize code, but it does not force to have a `class` keyword in Language. Please check this Appendix if you're curious about what is OOP from a Computer Science point of view: [C++ Technical Note/Object Orientated Design
](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#object-orientated-design).

# Philosophy of Python

If you want to understand some hidden principles built-in Python language then after having a workable version of Python Interpreter read the output from the following command:
```bash
python -c "import this"
```
This provides a point of view of the world from the point of view of Python.


# If you arrived at Python from C++

## About Events
Some programming languages like C# contain native support of event-based communication between objects to support Object Orientated Programming, however, Python (and C++) programming language does not contain a native event-based system, even though there are frameworks on top of it that supports that (for example Qt). 

## Meaning of Object

There is a clash of terminology if you have a C++, Java, or C# background. In Python, everything that takes up memory in some form is called the **object**. In other languages (Java, C#, C++) object is an instance of the class. So an object in Python terminology is:
* Class instances 
* Exotic built-in objects (e.g. files)
* Fundamental built-in data types (e.g. integers)

It's not true that all things are classes in Python.

## Python does Provide Access to Variables by Value

Python has named references to objects. It has no variables available to the programmer for reference by value (at least at the level of Language). Functions return and accept arguments by reference in the terminology of C++, C#, and Java.

Moreover, there is a very strange thing with default argument which was in Python since the early version. For the default argument - the default value itself is passed by reference and *calculated once*. 

This (unfortunately) creates an implicit global default value object. For C++ this is not observed, because arguments are passed by value, in the usual way of writing arguments, and is just a shorthand at least conceptually.

## Context in Python is the Same as Scopes in C++

The context in Python is a concept similar to C++'s scope. However, in Python, you can not create scopes inside the function. For example if inside the function you have a nested loop, then its level of nested loop **does not** introduce a new scope. In fact, in Python, there are only 4 contexts (which are in C++ terminology called scopes):

* **Local Context/Scope.** The context inside the current function. As we have mentioned earlier a new loop with a new indentation does not introduce a new local scope.

* **Enclosing Context/Scope.** Locally declare a function inside a function. Variables from the parent function will be implicitly accessible to the children.

* **Global Context/Scope.** Variables from the top level of the module.

* **Built-in Context/Scope.** Built-in variables and functions are built into the interpreter.

## Pointers and Object Reference Equality

Object in Python is everything that takes memory. Fundamentally in Python Object equality can test in one of two types:

**Value equality** - testing that takes a reference to objects. And what is tested the objects have the same content. The programmer can define what this means via defining `__eq__` in your class. This operator semantically is the same as `==` in C++.

**Identity equality** - testing when two references are referenced to the same object. The programmer can not determine what it means, it is defined by the language. Such type of equality is used during the use of operators `is`, `is not` or built-in function `id()`.

In Python 2/3 there are no pointers. However, there is a built-in function called `id`. In fact function `id(obj)` according to [1],[2] means the address of an object in the interpreter's memory. 

In principle that two objects refer to the same memory can be checked in the following way:
```python
id(x) == id(y)
```

However in reality you will not meet this code too much. If you need to compare references to an object, then this action is typically performed by using the operators:
* `is`
* `is not`

They have the same semantical meaning as using `id()`.

> The fact that `id(x)` is the memory address of object *x* is a CPython implementation detail. CPython can change this in the future. It's also hard to say what is guaranteed by the standard - because there is no standard.


## All Class Methods are Virtual in Terms of C++

Without loss of generality, we can assume that in Python all methods of all classes are `virtual`. But actually, there are no virtual methods virtual keywords, and virtual tables in Python at all. In fact, in Python methods are *attributes*. They are bound at runtime and executed dynamically. 

In very specific circumstances you can manually remove, get, and set attributes:

* [delattr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=getattr#delattr) - remove an attribute

* [hasattr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=getattr#hasattr) - checks if an attribute exists.

* [setattr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=getattr#setattr) - set the value of an attribute

* [getattr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=getattr#getattr) - get the value of an attribute

There is also no division of fields into public/private/protected as it is in C++ and there are no different types of inheritances. However, in Python, there is a limited type of support for `private` names, which we will describe later.

## Some Language Differences Between Python and C++

1. Assignments opertor `=` does not copy data. The language just binds a right object to the left operand of the `=` operator.
2. In Python class data attributes override method attributes with the same name. To avoid accidental name conflicts, which may cause hard-to-find bugs in large programs, it is wise to use some kind of convention that minimizes the chance of conflicts.
3. Nothing in Python makes it possible to enforce data hiding - it is all based upon convention.
4. In Python, when using logical connectives, the result of a compound expression is equal to the result of the last subexpression evaluated. In C and C++ the result of a Boolean expression with short-circuiting is always an integer 0 or 1:

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        std::cout << (12 || 2);
        return 0;
    }
    // Out: 1
    ```

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    print(12 or 2)
    # Out: 12
    ```

5. Python has the `elif` keyword. For Python, it's crucial because their syntax rules require creating indentation between `else` and `if`. The absence of such a keyword potentially will make the source code less readable. C++ Language is more flexible, and such a keyword is absent in C/C++ but is presented in the C Language Preprocessor. Example:

    ```python
    if x < 0:
        pass
    elif x == 0:
        pass
    else:
        pass
    ```

6. In Python you may have the else branch inside the loops. If you did not read Python Tutorial [1] it can be the case that you never heard about it. This logic in the else path of a loop statement is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of the iterable or when the condition becomes false. However, the `else` path will not be executed if the loop has been early terminated with `break` statement. See Also: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops

7. In Python there is the "exotic" operator `**` is used. This operator can raise integers, real, and complex numbers to specific power. Such a built-in operator is absent in C++.

8. Unlike many C-based languages, Python does not have a unary post(postfix) `++` increment or `--` decrement operators.

9. The boolean literals are named as `true`, `false` in C++. However, in Python, they are named as `True`, `False`. The underlying type `bool` has the same typing both in C++ and in Python.

10. In C/C++ you have the ability to implicitly cast expression to bool or integer type. In Python the following expressions are considered `False`: `None`, `0`, `empty sequence`.

11. Python uses `.`` to separate packages/subpackage/class like C#, and Java.

12. In Python (and in Perl) there is no such term as function overloading.

# Sources of Confusion if C++ person will talk to Python person

Python is a useful and nice *scripting language*, which of course more comfortable to use compared to [Perl](https://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/) or [Windows Batch](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Windows_Batch_Scripting) and sometimes more comfortable to use compare to [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html). In our experience [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) is still more easy to use if the script contains executing external processes for different tasks and less logic.

Python has a very fast learning curve which opened the door fortunately for people not only in CS to create useful scripts in day-to-day life.

> Python is a programming language which...

Unfortunately, if you are around people with CS/EE/System/Compilers backgrounds it may be the case that these people will make a statement: *"Python is not a programming language"*.  To state that Python is *Programming Language* we need to define what is (1) programming and what is a (2) Language. 

One meaning is that Language expresses ideas and you don't care at all how these ideas are materialized. But it's not the only definition. 

The message which one scientist [B. Stroustroup](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Rr9Y8acAAAAJ&hl=ru&oi=ao) (author of C++) tries to bring for people for already 3 decades that *Programming Language* is the language that gives you a way to describe the algorithm and this algorithm will be executed in the computer (compute device). With this very strict definition [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) are not Programming Languages. Python is an interpreter. C# and Java are runtimes coupled with a Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler.

If you only start with Programming in your career, or if you have no experience in Compilers/OS/Systems you may not see the difference, but there is a fundamental difference. It does not say that these languages are incorrect, but at least understand that it's not the computer that executes this program, but what is executing is another (one more) level of abstraction. Any level of Abstraction is not free in terms of consumed memory and execution time.

> Python is a general-purpose programming language.

It is at the same time a very strong statement and at the same time vague statement. It can be three points of view on such a statement:

1. By general-purpose programming language you mean that you can create any Algorithm in it. If this is a definition, then it's correct. Only DSL languages constructed for special purposes may have a lack of being [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).

2. By General Purpose you mean that you can use it across many domains. But how big is big? Depending on the definition of "Big" Python may lie in this class.

3. By General Purpose you mean you can create programs for different computing elements in the Computer. If this is your definition and you believe that Python can help with this - it's *wrong*. Python by design is the replacement for Bash, it's not a replacement for C or C++, or any other traditional language. Conter example: You can not create drivers for your devices.

> Python is more elegant and short than C++.

One more time it depends on what you mean exactly. This is true if look into lines of code. However, the first thing in creating algorithms - they should be correct. In our experience, what is interesting after some amount of code is that there is a very strange asymmetry that you will observe once you create projects in Python and C++ with 40K lines of code and more. With at least such a big size Python is not even close to C++. Because compiling languages forces you to follow some discipline.

Of course, there is a tool for Python that helps [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/), but a compiler and linker are far more powerful tools for detecting errors than a static analyzer.

> Python is everywhere

This overstatement can also be read from the Python Tutorial.

Please be aware that (any) interpretable language which exists or will be created in the future fundamentally will have the following downsides:

[C++ Technical Note / Downsides of Interpretable Languages
](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#downsides-of-interpretable-languages).

# Python Technical Basics

## Python Language Benefits over Other Scripting Languages

It depends on your point of view and your style, but there is a point of view where the following things are benefits. 

Especially if you have limited time to finish a project:

  1. More correct code from a style point of view.
  2. Automatic cross-platform serialization "pickling" for the user and built-in types from the Python standard library.
  3. A lot of free and commercial IDE with IntelliSense.
  4. Built-in debugger. 
  5. Python uses <`.`> token to separate packages/subpackage/classes like C# and Java. Packages from Perl are called modules in Python.

During debugging it's worthwhile to say that parsing of the function is performed only at the moment of the direct call. 

To run the script with a debugger call:

```bash
python -m pdb scriptname.py
```

After this, you will have the ability to insert text commands in the interactive shell with [pdb commands](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands).

Documentation: [pdb â The Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html?highlight=pdb#module-pdb).

## How to Start Interpreter

Based on [1] the Python interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell. There are three ways to start the Python interpreter:

1. When it is called with standard input connected to a device - it reads and executes commands interactively.

2. When a Python interpreter is called with a file name argument it reads and executes a script from that file. For details see [Python Tutorial / Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3.13/tutorial/interpreter.html)

3. You can start the interpreter by calling
    ```bash
    python -c command [arg] ...
    ```
    It executes the statement(s) in the command, analogous to the shell s `-c` option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote the command.

4. Some Python modules can be used as scripts. These can be invoked using `python -m module [arg] ...`, which executes the source file for the module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.

**Script Arguments.** The script name and additional arguments are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the `sys.argv` variable with the following rules:

* When no script and no arguments are given, `sys.argv[0]` is an empty string. 

* When the script name is given as `-` it means standard input, and `sys.argv[0]` is set to '-'. 

* When you execute a Python interpreter with the `-c` command used, sys.argv[0] is set to `-c`:
  ```bash 
  python -c "import sys; print(sys.argv)"
  ```

*  When the `-m` module is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to the full name of the located module.


## What is a False Statement

The following expressions are considered `false` in Python:
* `None`
* `0`
* Sequence which `len() == 0` named as empty sequence.

##  First Line in Your Script

The line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` in a well is called sha-bang. It has a long history in Unix/Linux OS. For Windows, it's possible to use it as well. In Windows a binary application named `py.exe` is a launcher with performs a choice of a used interpreter based on the mentioned sha-bang.

## Possible Second Line. Source File Encoding.

The source file by itself is represented in characters. Characters that constitute the file content can be in any supported encoding https://docs.python.org/3.13/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings. By default, Python source files are treated to be encoded in UTF-8. To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file or a second line in the file if the first line is sha-bang:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
```

## First Lines of Script

Physical lines in the source code of a script are physical lines inside the text file encoded with one of the possible encodings.

A Logical line of a program is constructed from one or more physical lines by following the explicit or implicit line-joining rules:

* When a physical line ends in a backslash `\` character that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the following end-of-line character.

* A physical and logical line that contains only spaces, tabs, and possibly a comment is ignored by the parser.

* Normally you should use `\` for line continuation, however, Python supports automatically multi-line continuation inside:
  * Expressions in parentheses `()`
  * Expressions in square brackets `[]`
  * Expressions in curly braces `{}`
  

When you are inside such an expression you can split your expression over more than one physical line without using the backslash symbol. 

A Python script is read by a parser. The parsing of some pieces of Python source code (e.g. of the function) is performed only at the moment of the direct call of this function.

## Comments

Comments in Python start with the hash character `#` and extend to the end of the physical line.

## Operator Precedence

Based on [C++ Tehnical Note/Lexical Analysis](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#lexical-analysis) - in the terminology of Programming Languages, tokens are separate words of a program text. In most programming languages, the tokens fundamentally can be one of the following types:

* a. **Operators**
* b. Separators
* c. Identifiers
* d. Keywords
* e. Literal constants

So operators in Programming is one of the five fundamental language concepts. Information about operator precedence in Python Language is available here:
https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence

## Simple Built-In Types

* **Ellipsis.** There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the literal `...`. If the expression `...` is used inside the condition, then `...` is implicitly converted into `True`.

* **NoneType.** This type has a single value and there is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name `None`. It is used to signify the absence of a value in many situations. Also, it is returned from functions that do not explicitly return anything. If this expression is used inside the condition, then `...` is implicitly converted into `False`.

* **Integers (int)**. The type that is used to represent integers in Python interpreter does not have any fixed number of bits. Instead, it has a varying size. In this sense, an integer has an unlimited range. You can practically hold as big an integer as you want until you start having problems with virtual memory.

* **numbers. Real (float).** This type represents machine-level double-precision floating point numbers. From Documentation: *"...there is no reason to complicate the language with two kinds of floating-point numbers..."* It's the design choice for a language. Of course, for people involved in scientific numerics, such a statement is deeply wrong and sometimes laughable only in the case of writing software that takes care of compute time and memory footprint.

Documentation on this subject: https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/datamodel.html

## Simple Statements

Typically, a simple statement is comprised of a single logical line. However, several simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons. Example:
```python
a=1;b=2;
```

For a more precise definition see: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html

## Compound Statements

Generally, compound statements are written on multiple logical lines using indentation, although sometimes if a compound statement has only one branch in it, and the body of it contains only simple statements, it can be written on a single logical line. Example:

```python
if 1: print (2); print (2); #legal python code
```

## Empty(Pass) Statements
The `pass` statement does nothing similar to the C++ `;` statement.

## Division of Numbers in Python
The division operator in Python `/` always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use the `//` operator. 

To calculate the remainder, you can use `%` similar to C/C++/Java.

## Printing

The standard way to print something in Python 3 is by utilizing the built-in [print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) function. 

There exists a style for printing with a C\# style string format:
```python
print("Hello {1} / {0}".format(12,14))
```

The default behavior is to output the line into `stdout` with a new line. If you don't want to output a new line then in Python 3 you can specify the end character in the following way:
```python
print("hello",end='!')
```

If you want to print not to `stdout`, but to `stderr` it can be attained in the following way:
```python
import sys
print("hello {0}".format("world"), end='\n',file=sys.stderr)
```

You can use various formatting rules described here to configure output:
https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/string.html#formatspec

Since Python 3.6 is in the interpreter, a string interpolation feature has been added (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/). It is presented in Bash and similar scripting languages.
Example:
```python
a = 123
print (f"Hello {a}")
```

The f-string form is known as a formatted string literal. To use formatted string literals, you should begin a string with `for `F` before the opening quotation mark.

Inside this string, you can write an arbitrary Python expression between `{` and `}`. For example, you can refer to variables or literal values. During using f-string you can pass an integer after the `:`. It will cause that field to be a minimum number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up. Example:
```python
a = 123
print (f"Hello {a:10}")
```

Next, there is one extra feature that can be useful during debugging.
The `=` specifier can be used to expand an expression too:
* Text of the expression in text form
* An equal sign
* Representation of the evaluated expression

Example:
```python
a = 123
print(f"{a=}")
```

String interpolation (named formatted string literal) is evaluated during script execution. In terms of type, they are just `str` and it's not a new type. Implementing in C++ or any compiling language such functionality is impossible (of course if you don't want to write your interpreter inside your project).

Finally, old string formatting from Python 2 which is still supported in Python 3 for C style `printf()` C++ specification. Example:
```python
print("%i %.2f" % (1, 0.12345))
```

## Enumeration and Loops

Python's `for` statement iterates over the items of any sequence. If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function [range()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#range) function will help you with that:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

The object returned by `range()` behaves as if it is a list, but it is not. It is an object of class `range` that returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it. It does not make the list, thus saving space.

When you are looping through dictionaries you are enumerating through `keys`. If the key and corresponding value are important to you, then you can retrieve the value and key at the same time.  For doing it you should use the [items()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=items#dict.items) method in the dictionary built-in type.

Next, when you are looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time using the `enumerate()` function. Example:

```python
for  index, value in enumerate([10,11,23]):
  print(index, value)
```

To loop over a sequence in reverse, first, specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call the `reversed()` function. To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the `sorted()` function which returns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered. Using `set()` on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements because it creates the set.

## More on Conditions

The conditions used in `while` and `if` statements can contain any operators.

* The comparison operators `in` and `not in` are membership tests.
* The operators `is` and `is not` compare whether two objects are the same object in memory.

What can confuse people with C++/Java/C#/C backgrounds is that comparisons can be chained. For example, `a < b == c` tests the following *"a is less than b **and** b equals c"*. 

Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators `and` and `or`, `not`. The Boolean operators `and` and `or` are so-called short-circuit operators and are analogous to `&&` and `||`. 

Python supports the same set of the bitwise operator as it in C/C++ languages (See [operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence)) and it includes: `&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`, `~`.

In Python when you use an expression (not necessarily Boolean) that internally uses Boolean operators, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated expression (which is not the case in C++ where you don't obtain this information):

```python
#/usr/bin/env python3
# Python
a=123 or 12
print(a)
# Output: 123
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  int a = 123 || 12;  
  // (Alternative) notation "123 or 12" is rarely used in C++

  std::cout << a;
  // Output: 1
  return 0;
}
```

## Basic Data Types
Python has a number of basic types including integers, floats, booleans, and strings. These data types behave in ways that are familiar to other programming languages.

```python
x = 3
print(type(x)) # Prints "<class 'int'>"
print(x)       # Prints "3"
print(x + 1)   # Addition; prints "4"
print(x - 1)   # Subtraction; prints "2"
print(x * 2)   # Multiplication; prints "6"
print(x ** 2)  # Exponentiation; prints "9"
x += 1
print(x)       # Prints "4"
x *= 2
print(x)       # Prints "8"
y = 2.5
print(type(y))                 # Prints "<class 'float'>"
print(y, y + 1, y * 2, y ** 2) # Prints "2.5 3.5 5.0 6.25"
```

## Bool Variables and Boolean Operators

Python implements all of the usual operators for Boolean logic, but uses English words rather than special symbols (such as `&&`, `||`, etc.):

```python
t = True
f = False
print(type(t)) # Prints "<class 'bool'>"
print(t and f) # Logical AND; prints "False"
print(t or f)  # Logical OR; prints "True"
print(not t)   # Logical NOT; prints "False"
print(t != f)  # Logical XOR; prints "True"
```

Booleans are also the results of comparisons like:
```python
a = 3
b = 5
c = 7
print(a == a)     # Prints "True"
print(a != a)     # Prints "False"
print(a < b)      # Prints "True"
print(a <= a)     # Prints "True"
print(a <= b < c) # Prints "True"
```

## Containers
Python includes several built-in container types: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. Containers are devoted to storing values.

A list is the Python equivalent of an array (conceptually, even inside Python interpreter it's really implemented as a list), but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types:

```python
xs = [3, 1, 2]    # Create a list
print(xs, xs[2])  # Prints "[3, 1, 2] 2"
print(xs[-1])     # Negative indices count from the end of the list; prints "2"
xs[2] = 'foo'     # Lists can contain elements of different types
print(xs)         # Prints "[3, 1, 'foo']"
xs.append('bar')  # Add a new element to the end of the list
print(xs)         # Prints "[3, 1, 'foo', 'bar']"
x = xs.pop()      # Remove and return the last element of the list
print(x, xs)      # Prints "bar [3, 1, 'foo']"
```

In addition to accessing list elements one at a time, Python provides concise syntax to access the sublist. This is known as slicing. We will see slicing again in the context of NumPy arrays.

```python
nums = list(range(5)) # range is a function that creates a list of integers
print(nums)           # Prints "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[2:4])      # Slice from index 2 to 4 (exclusive); prints "[2, 3]"
print(nums[2:])       # Get a slice from index 2 to the end; prints "[2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[:2])       # Slice from the start-up to index 2; prints "[0, 1]"
print(nums[:])        # Get a slice of the whole list; prints "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]"
print(nums[:-1])      # Slice indices can be negative; prints "[0, 1, 2, 3]"
nums[2:4] = [8, 9]    # Assign a new sublist to a slice
print(nums)           # Prints "[0, 1, 8, 9, 4]"
```

## Comparison of Containers 

Sequence objects (typically) can be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering.

## Strings

Python has great support for strings:

```python
hello = 'hello'    # String literals can use single quotes
world = "world"    # or double quotes; it does not matter.

print(hello)       # Prints "hello"
print(len(hello))  # String length; prints "5"

hw = hello + ' ' + world  # String concatenation
print(hw)                 # Prints "hello world"

hw12 = '%s %s %d' % (hello, world, 12)  # C/C++ sprintf style string formatting
print(hw12)                             # prints "hello world 12"

hw21 = '{} {} {}'.format(hello, world, 21)  # formatting with format function in C# style
print(hw21)                                 # prints "hello world 21"
hw13 = '{} {} {:.2f}'.format(hello, world, 1 / 3)  # float formatting
print(hw13)                                        # prints "hello world 0.33"
hw3 = f'{hello} {world} {1 / 3:.2f}' # the f-strings
print(hw3)                           # prints "hello world 0.33"
```

String objects have a bunch of useful methods, for example:

```python
s = "hello"
print(s.capitalize())           # Capitalize a string; prints "Hello"
print(s.upper())                # Convert a string to uppercase; prints "HELLO"
print(s.rjust(7))               # Right-justify a string; prints "  hello"
print(s.center(7))              # Center a string; prints " hello "
print(s.replace('l', '(ell)'))  # Replace all instances; prints "he(ell)(ell)o"
print('  wo rld '.strip())      # Strip surrounding whitespace; prints "wo rld"
```

Python can manipulate with strings, which can be expressed in several ways:

* String enclosed in single quotes ('...') can use double quotes <"> inside the string literal.
* String enclosed in double quotes ("...") can use single quotes <'> inside the string literal.
* String enclosed in triple quotes ("""...""") or ('''...''') is a multiline string. Multiline strings can be placed in several strings. In this case, the used new line character is part of the string literal.
* The raw string literal is represented as r"..." or r'...' or r'''...''' or r"""...""". Inside the raw string you can use backslash characters in the usual way. The raw string notion is similar to C++11 construction `R"(hello\n)"`.
* Two or more string literals next to each other are automatically concatenated without using the plus sign. This syntax and semantics coincide exactly with C++/C.

## Dictionaries

A dictionary stores (key, value) pairs. You can use it like this:

```python
d = {'cat': 'cute', 'dog': 'furry'}  # Create a new dictionary with some data
print(d['cat'])       # Get an entry from a dictionary; prints "cute"
print('cat' in d)     # Check if a dictionary has a given key; prints "True"
d['fish'] = 'wet'     # Set an entry in a dictionary
print(d['fish'])      # Prints "wet"
# print(d['monkey'])  # KeyError: 'monkey' not a key of d
print(d.get('monkey', 'N/A'))  # Get an element with a default; prints "N/A"
print(d.get('fish', 'N/A'))    # Get an element with a default; prints "wet"
del d['fish']         # Remove an element from a dictionary
print(d.get('fish', 'N/A')) # "fish" is no longer a key; prints "N/A"
```

## Sets
A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. As a simple example, consider the following:
```python
animals = {'cat', 'dog'}
print('cat' in animals)   # Check if an element is in a set; prints "True"
print('fish' in animals)  # prints "False"
animals.add('fish')       # Add an element to a set
print('fish' in animals)  # Prints "True"
print(len(animals))       # Number of elements in a set; prints "3"
animals.add('cat')        # Adding an existing element does nothing
print(len(animals))       # Prints "3"
animals.remove('cat')     # Remove an element from a set
print(len(animals))       # Prints "2"
```

## Loops
You can loop over the elements of a list like this:
```python
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'monkey']
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)
```

If you want access to the index of each element and the element itself within the body of a loop, use the built-in `enumerate` function:

```python
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'monkey']
for idx, animal in enumerate(animals):
    print(f'#{idx+1}: {animal}')
```

It is easy to iterate over the keys in a dictionary:

```python
d = {'person': 2, 'cat': 4, 'spider': 8}
for animal in d:
    legs = d[animal]
    print(f'A {animal} has {legs} legs')
```

If you want access to keys and their corresponding values, it's better to use `items` method:

```python
d = {'person': 2, 'cat': 4, 'spider': 8}
for animal, legs in d.items():
    print('A %s has %d legs' % (animal, legs))
```

Iterating over a set has the same syntax as iterating over a list. However, since sets are unordered, you cannot make assumptions about the order in which you visit the elements of the set:
```python
animals = {'cat', 'dog', 'fish'}
for idx, animal in enumerate(animals):
    print('#%d: %s' % (idx + 1, animal))
```

# Python Technical Details: One step after Basics

## Interfaces and Protocols

In Python languages, you will not find the keyword `interface` such as in Java/C# or pure virtual class methods as in C++. Python does not have interfaces as a language concept. 

Instead of a specific (and robust) interface notion Python (and other scripting languages) uses what is known as Duck Typing. This concept is described typically in the following way:

> *"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"*.

In Python, any object may be used in any context until it is used in a way that it does not support. In this latter case the [AttributeError](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError) will be raised.

If you define your classes in Python and you want the objects of your class can be used in specific language construction (like) iteration you should support **protocol**:

* **Container protocol.** Built-in container types in Python
tuple, list, str, dict, set, range, and bytes all support `in`, and `not in` operations for them. Support of this is named container protocol. For your types, you should define 
  ```python
  def __contains__ (self, item)
  ```

* **Sized protocol.** Built-in container types in Python support `len(x)` operator. For your types, you should define:

  ```python
  def __len__(self)
  ```

- **Iterable protocol.** Built-in container types in Python support the [iter(x)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter), [next(x)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next) operators. 

  Such objects can be used in for-loops:
  ```python
  for i in iterable: smth(i)
  ```
  For your types you should define:
    ```python
    def __iter__(self) 
    def __next__(self)
    ```

  More details:  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#iterators

- **Sequence protocol.** Except `dict`, all built-in container types in Python support indexing. It's known as *sequence protocol*. For your classes, you should define [__getitem__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__getitem__#object.__getitem__), [__setitem__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setitem__), [__delitem__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__getitem__#object.__delitem__). Once you will define these operators you can use the following language operators:

  ```python
  x [integral_index] 
  x.index(someValue) 
  x.count(someValue) 
  produceReverseSeq = reversed(x)
  ```

## Introspection of System

One way to get information about the interpreter version:
```bash
python --version
```

Collect information about the installed interpreter and system from the interpreter itself:
```python
import os, platform, socket
print("==================================================")
print("Information about your system")
print("==================================================")
print(f"Python interpreter: {sys.executable}")
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Platform name: {sys.platform}")
print("==================================================")
print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
(system, node, release, version, machine, processor) = platform.uname()
print(f"OS name: {system}/{release}/{version}")
print(f"Host: {socket.gethostname()} / IP: {socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())}")
```

## Introspection of Python Objects
In Python, everything is an object.  The [dir(obj)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir) built-in function displays the attributes of an object.  Attributes that all objects (typically) have:
* `__name__` - is the name of the object such as a function.
* `__doc__` - documentation string for the object.
* `__class__` - type name of the object.

Example:
```python
a = 1
print(a.__class__)
```


## Comprehensions Syntax

Comprehensions Syntax provides a short syntax to create several inerrable types with short expressions. List comprehensions in Python:
```python
[expr(item) for an item in iterable if condition (item)]  
```

Set comprehensions in Python:
```python
{expr(item) for an item in iterable if condition (item)}
```

Dictionary comprehensions in Python:
```python
{someKey:someValue for someKey, someValue in someDict.items() if condition(someKey, someValue)}
```

Generator comprehensions in Python: 
```python
(expr(item) for item in iterable if condition(item))
```

List comprehension is described in Python Tutorial [1]: 
[list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions), [nested list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#nested-list-comprehensions)

## Working with List Dictionary and Set Comprehensions

When programming, frequently we want to transform one type of data into another. As a simple example, consider the following code that computes square numbers:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = []
for x in nums:
    squares.append(x ** 2)
print(squares)   # Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

You can make this code simpler using a list comprehension:
```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [x ** 2 for x in nums]
print(squares)   # Prints [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

List comprehensions can also contain conditions:
```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)
```

Also, in Python, there is a syntax for Dictionary comprehension. These are similar to list comprehensions, but allow you to easily construct dictionaries. For example:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
even_num_to_square = {x: x ** 2 for x in nums if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_num_to_square)
```

Like lists and dictionaries, we can easily construct sets using set comprehensions:

```python
from math import sqrt
nums = {int(sqrt(x)) for x in range(30)}
print(nums)
```

## Tuples

A tuple is an (immutable) ordered list of values. A tuple is in many ways similar to a list. One of the most important differences is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot. Tuples are created using parenthesis in the following form: `(elementA, elementA)`. Example:

```python
d = {(x, x + 1): x for x in range(10)}  # Create a dictionary with tuple keys
t = (5, 6)                              # Create a tuple
print(type(t))                          # Prints "<class 'tuple'>"
print(d[t])                             # Prints "5"
print(d[(1, 2)])                        # Prints "1"
```

## Working with Tuples

A tuple consists of several values separated by commas. It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however, it is possible to create tuples that contain mutable objects, such as lists. Tuples are immutable and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking.

A tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value in parentheses). And so to create a tuple with one element is possible only with this required syntactic trick. Example:
```python
a = (12,)  
```

Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses. Example:
```python
 a = ()
```

You can create a tuple from the list:
 ```python
b = tuple([1,2,23])
 ```

If you want to include tuples in another tuple you need to use parentheses `()`, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly. Example of creating a tuple with 2 elements where the second element is a tuple by itself:
 ```python
 a=(1,(2,3,4,5,6))
 ```

## Unpacking of Containers

All containers can be unpacked as follows:

```python
t = (3, 2, 1)
a, b, c = t  # unpacks the tuple t; prints "3 2 1"
print(a, b, c)

l = [3, 2, 1]
a, b, c = l  # unpacks the list l; prints "3 2 1"
print(a, b, c)

s = {3, 2, 1}
a, b, c = s  # unpacks the set s; prints "1 2 3" (set ordering)
print(a, b, c)

d = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}
a, b, c = d            # unpacks the keys of the dict d; prints "c b a"
print(a, b, c)
ak, bk, ck = d.keys()  # unpacks the keys of the dict d; prints "c b a"
print(ak, bk, ck)
a, b, c = d.values()   # unpacks the values of the dict d; prints "3 2 1"
print(a, b, c)
(ak, a), (bk, b), (ck, c) = d.items()  # unpacks key-value tuples of the dict d
print(ak, bk, ck)      # prints "c b a"
print(a, b, c)         # prints "3 2 1"
```

The asterisk (`*`) can be used as an unpacking operator:
```python
l = [3, 2, 1]     # a list
t = (4, 5, 6)     # a tuple
s = {9, 8, 7}     # a set
b = [*s, *t, *l]  # unpacks s, t, and l side to side in a new list
print(b)          # prints "[8, 9, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1]"
b = (*s, *t, *l)  # unpacks s, t, and l side to side in a new tuple
print(b)          # prints "(8, 9, 7, 4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1)"
b = {*s, *t, *l}  # unpacks s, t, and l side to side in a new set
print(b)          # prints "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}"
```

For dictionaries, we use the double-asterisks (`**`) or the (`zip`) function:

```python
d1 = {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1}
d2 = {'d': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6}
d = {**d1, **d2}
print(d)                 
# Prints: {'c': 3, 'b': 2, 'a': 1, 'd': 4, 'e': 5, 'f': 6}

keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
values = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(zip(keys, values)))
# Prints: zip

d = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(d)
# Prints: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Functions: Introduction

Python functions are defined using the `def` keyword. For example:

```python
def sign(x):
    if x > 0:
        return 'positive'
    elif x < 0:
        return 'negative'
    else:
        return 'zero'

for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
    print(sign(x))
```

You can also define variadic functions, like this:

```python
def hello(*names, **kwargs):
    if 'loud' in kwargs and kwargs['loud']:
        print('HELLO, {}!'.format([name.upper() for name in names]))
    else:
        print('Hello, %s' % [name for name in names])

hello()                          # Prints "Hello, []"
hello('Bob', 'Fred')             # Prints "Hello, ['Bob', 'Fred']"
hello('Bob', 'Fred', loud=True)  # Prints "HELLO, ['BOB', 'FRED']!"
```

## Classes

## User Defined Classes in Python

Firstly, Python has limited support for private attribute objects. When you name attributes as `__attributename` the interpreter performs name mangling. In reality, this attribute in case have access to it outside methods of the class will have the name `_classname__attribute`. In C++ terminology Python classes have the following characteristics:
  1. Normal class members (including the data members) are public except for some small support for Private Variables.
  2. All member functions/methods are virtual.
  3. Like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic operators, etc.) can be redefined for user-defined classes.
  4. Python Data attributes correspond to "data members" in C ++.
  5. Python supports multiple inheritance, and exceptions.
  6. In Python (and in Perl) there is no such term as function overloading.

## The Syntax for Defining Classes

The syntax for defining classes in Python is straightforward and has the following form:

```python
class Greeter(object):
    
    # Static variable
    sneezes = 0

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
        # super().__init__()  # call to the constructor of the parent class
        self.name = name  # Create an instance variable

    # Instance method
    def greet(self, loud=False):
        if loud:
            print('HELLO, %s!' % self.name.upper())
        else:
            print('Hello, %s' % self.name)

    @staticmethod
    def sneeze(n_a=1, n_o=2):
        print('A' * n_a + 'CH' + 'O' * n_o + '!!')
        Greeter.sneezes += 1
        
    def __str__(self):  # The str dunder (or magic) function
        return f'Greeter for {self.name}'

g = Greeter('Fred')  # Construct an instance of the Greeter class
g.greet()            # Call an instance method; prints "Hello, Fred"
g.greet(loud=True)   # Call an instance method; prints "HELLO, FRED!"
g.sneeze()           # Call a static method through an object; prints "ACHOO!!"
Greeter.sneeze()     # Call a static method through the class; prints "ACHOO!!"
print(g)             # Call __str__; prints "Greeter for Fred"
```

## Random Interesting Constructions

1. Work with the reverse sequence:
    ```python
    for i in reversed([1,3]): 
        print i  
    ```

2. Dictionary (also known as a map or associative array in other languages) can be built through `{}`, which takes as input a list of pair-tuples with key and value separated by a column.
    ```python
    emptyDictinoary = {}
    ```

3. Dict can be merged with another dict via [update()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=update#dict.update) method.

4. In Python another datatype that is built-in in the Language is set. On sets, you can perform set-theoretic operations. Example:
    ```python
    aSet = {1,2}   # set
    ```

5. Creating an empty set, possible only through the constructor `set()`. It is because `{}` is reserved as an empty dictionary description and interpreter due to its design (it has a Dynamic Type System) can not derive information that you want an empty set, no dictionary. Example:
    ```python
    emptySet = set()
    ```

6. Exceptions with variable names.

    See [Handling Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions). Example:


    ```python
    def hello(a): 	
      try:  		
        raise ValueError() 
        return +2  	
      except (ValueError, TypeError)  as e :    		
        return -1 	
      finally:  		
        #clean code  		
        pass
    ```

7. There is a ternary expression similar to the C/C++ `?:` expression. Example:
    ```python
    sym = '0' if 1> 5 else ''1" 
    ```

    Documentation: https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions

8. Launch the Python web server to share files from the current directory:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

9. Deleted statement. Delete statement `del` is used to delete elements from a container such as a list. Also, it is used to delete variables from the interpreter. After variable deletion, the variable is not defined. If a variable is not "defined" which means it has not been assigned a value or deleted, trying to use it for reading will give you an error. Trying to use it for writing will create a new variable. Objects are never explicitly destroyed. When they become unreachable they may be garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented.

10. Multiple assignments in Python:
    ```python
    a, b = 0, 1
    ```

# Technical Details about Language Concepts

## Convention about Variable Names

| **Convention**      | **Example** | **Meaning** |
|---------------|------------|------------------------|
| Single Leading Underscore  | `_var` |  This naming convention indicates a name is meant for internal use. Generally (with one exception) not enforced by the Python interpreter. In this case, it was meant as a hint to the programmer only. The exception case is the behavior of wildcard imports. During import using the wildcard symbol (`from my_module import *`), these symbols will not be imported in the global namespace. |
| Single Trailing Underscore     | `var_`         | Used by convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords.          |
| Double Leading Underscore      | `__var`Â           | Triggers name mangling when used in a class context. Enforced by the Python interpreter to make name mangling for variables. Python interpreter will automatically use correct mangling inside methods of the class. Outside the class, Python interpreters will not perform any name mangling. |
| Double Leading and Trailing Underscore | `__var__`        | Indicates special methods defined by the Python language. Avoid this naming scheme for your attributes. |
| Single Underscore         | `_`          | Sometimes used as a name for temporary or insignificant variables ("don't care"). Also, it is the result of the last expression in a Python REPL (interactive Python mode). |

## Variables Introspection

There are several ways to take a look at available symbols:

* [globals()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals) - will give you a dictionary of current available global variables
* [locals()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals) and [vars()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars) - will give you a dictionary of local variables
* [dir()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir) - will give you the list of in-scope variables which includes locals, and enclosed variables from another function if you use the style in which you define a function inside the function.


Example:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

my_global = 1

def f():
  my_enclosing = 2

  def g():
    nonlocal my_enclosing
    global g

    my_local = my_enclosing

    print("locals:", locals())
    print("globals:", globals())
    print("in-scope:", dir())
  g()

f()

# OUTPUT
#   locals: {'my_local': 2, 'my_enclosing': 2}
#   globals: {'__name__': '__main__', ..., 'my_global': 1, ...}
#   in-scope: ['my_enclosing', 'my_local']
```

These variations exist because there are several different contexts/scopes in Python as has been described in [Context in Python](#context-in-python-is-the-same-as-scopes-in-c) Section.

## Global and Nonlocal Variables

In example [Variables Introspection](#variables-introspection) we have used [nonlocal](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal), and [global](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) keywords. 

**global.** The global statement is a declaration that holds for the entire current code block. It means that the listed identifiers are to be interpreted as globals. Global variable scope changed immediately to the module-level binding without any intermediate outer scope, relative to the current scope. Also, it is impossible to assign value to a global variable without using `global`. You can refer to global variables if you want to read from them.

**nonlocal.**  The nonlocal statement causes the listed identifiers to refer to previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing scope excluding globals. So nonlocal variables changed the scope to the outer function. This is important because the default behavior for binding is to search the local namespace first. Names listed in a nonlocal statement must not collide with pre-existing bindings in the local scope.

You should use this variable access modifiers when you're going to write to the variable and provide an interpreter and hint about what you are going to do exactly:

* You want to define a new local variable and you provide the default value with the `=` operator
* You do not want to create a local variable, but instead, you want to write to a global variable or variable from a previous(nested) context.

In C++/C#/Java, such nonlocal scope is impossible because in these languages you cannot define a function inside another function. Synthetically in C++ you can define lambda function inside a function, but it is a syntax sugar. You can read more about Lambda C++ functions from [C++ Technical Note from C++1998 to C++2020/ Lambda Functions](https://github.com/burlachenkok/CPP_from_1998_to_2020/blob/main/Cpp-Technical-Note.md#lambda-functions). In C++ you cannot define a function inside a function because it does not add extra expressibility.


## Modules and Packages

### Modules
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py`. Python module files are files written with Python language and in general they look like usual scripts.  Within a module, the module name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`.  

Typically, you can launch the Python module as a script if the authors of the module provide some utility functionality. During launching the module, the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to "__main__".  The part of the code for executing the script in the module typically has the following condition:
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        pass
    ```
It provides means to distinguish behavior when the script is used for execution logic, rather than be a facade interface to some functionality.

To import the module the following instruction should be used:
```python
 import my_module
```

It is typical, but it is not required by interpreter design to place all import statements at the beginning of a module. The import statement does not add the names of the functions defined in `my_module` directly to the current namespace. Each module has its private namespace, which is used as the global namespace by all functions defined in the module. In the form of an import statement in the form of  `import my_module` all global symbols are defined in `my_module` and they are available through `my_module.<function|variable name>`.

Next, there is a variant of the import statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing modules namespace:
`from my_module import func_f, func_g`. In this form of import statement, the imported module name itself is not introduced into the global namespace of the current module.

The next variant is to import all names that a module defines `from my_module import *`. It imports all symbols from the module into the current module global namespace, except variables and functions whose names are started with an underscore `_`.

A module typically contains function and class definitions. But also, it can contain executable statements. These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed only the first time the module name is encountered in an import statement.

If the module name is followed by [as](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement), then the name following [as](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement) is bound directly to the imported module. Example:

```python
import my_module as my
```

To inspect the name defined in module `my` you should use the built-in function `dir()` e.g. in the following way `dir(my)`. It is used to find out which names a module defines. 

When you launch any Python scripts if all is OK in OS and you have enough privileges inside OS then the script will be launched and executed. However, it is important to mention that the `import` statement (by default) is executed only once per Python session. If you want to reload the module (e.g. because source code has been changed and you don't want to relaunch application) please consulate  [Module Reloading] (#module-reloading).

### Packages

Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using "dotted module names". Firstly, you should have several source code files with modules. To group these modules into the package you should place modules in one directory and create file `__init__.py` in this directory. The `__init__.py` files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages. This prevents directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, `__init__.py` can just be an empty file, but it can also execute the initialization code for the package or set the `__all__` variable.

If execute code:
```python
from package_name.module_name import *
```

The `__all__` variable defines the modules that you should import to a client who requested an [import wildcard form](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html?highlight=__all__#importing-from-a-package).

### Reference between Modules in Packages

There is a specific way to use relative addressing schemas between modules via intra-package reference schema. The intra-package reference imports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import. 

Relative imports are based on the name of the current module. A single dot means that the module or package referenced is in the same directory as the current location:
```python
from . import echo         
```

Two dots mean that it is in the parent directory of the current locationâthat is, the directory above:
```python
from .. import formats 
```

### Rules for Search Modules and Packages

When you import a module via keyword [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import) runtime importing the module via following the next rules:

1. The interpreter first searches for a built-in module. The built-in module names are built-in into the language and are listed in `sys.builtin_module_names`.

2. In a list of directories given by the variable `sys.path`.

Python programs can modify the `sys.path` variable itself, but the variable `sys.path` after starting the interpreter as a process Python Runtime initializes this variable with these locations:

* The directory containing the input script (or the current directory)
* Paths in environment variable PYTHONPATH
* The installation-dependent default such as the site-packages directory.

## About Functions: Now in Details

### About Indentation

Unfortunately, Python was designed using indentation, and there are no scopes constructed with `{}` as in C/C++. During writing language construction sometimes it can be shorter, but sometimes when you have 3-9 nested loops of Algorithm logic, the indentation makes the problem less readable and more error-prone. In principle, you can use both spaces and tabs, but it is recommended to use spaces instead of tabs according to this recommendation:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces

### Function Arguments and Return Value

The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal - this string literal is the functions documentation string, or docstring.

The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table.

Variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Global variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless you use `global` and `nolocal` statements). Although they may be referenced.

The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced by themselves in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called. Arguments are passed by value, where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object. A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table.

The `return` statement returns with a value from a function. Return without an expression argument returns None. Falling off the end of a function also returns `None`.

### Default Argument Value

The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. 

> Warning: The default value is evaluated only once.

### Keyword and Positional Arguments

Functions can be called using keyword arguments of the form `kwarg = value`. Keyword parameters are also referred to as *named parameters*. Rules for using keyword parameters are the following:

* In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments
* All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function
* No argument may receive a value more than once

### Syntax to Split Positional and Keyword Arguments

```python
def f(pos_only, pos_only_2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd_only_1, kwd_only_2):
    pass
```

Optionally used symbols `/` and `*` indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only, positional-or-keyword, and keyword-only.

### Varying Number of Arguments

You can specify that a function can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments.
One way is to use syntax to wrap varying positional arguments in a tuple. Example:

```python
def f(a, *args):
    print(type(args))
```

The second way is to use syntax to wrap varying keyword arguments into a dictionary. Specifically, when a final formal parameter in the function is in the `**name` it receives a dictionary containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. Example:

```python
def f(a, **args):
    print(type(args))
```

Next, if you want to call a function by passing a *tuple* and *dictionary*, but transfer this not as objects but make a substitution of the content of *tuple* and *dictionary* as a formal argument you should:
* Expand list and tuple with `*` for positional arguments only.
* Expand the dictionary (dict) with `**`for keyword arguments only.

Example:
```python
def printInfo(*x, **kv):
   print(x)
   print(kv)

x = (1,2) 
kv = {'a':2,'b':4,'c':6}

printInfo(*x, **kv)
printInfo(*x, aa = 1, bb = 9, cc = 1)

# Output:
# (1, 2)
# {'a': 2, 'b': 4, 'c': 6}
# (1, 2)
# {'aa': 1, 'bb': 9, 'cc': 1}
```

### Lambda Function

Small anonymous functions can be created with the lambda keyword. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. They are syntactically restricted to a single expression. 
```python
sum = lambda x,y: x+y
```

## Function and Type Annotation

Function annotations ([link](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#function-annotations)) and type annotation ([link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)) are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-defined functions (see [PEP 3107](https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/) and [PEP 484](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more information). 

Annotations are stored in the `__annotations__`attribute of the function as a dictionary. 

Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed by an expression evaluating the value of the annotation. Return function annotations are defined by a literal `->`, followed by an expression, similar to the trailing return type in C++.

Annotations do not affect any part of the function (if the function does not use this system metadata in its logic).

General Convention uses parameter annotations with expressions that produce a `type` value, and this functionality is used to augment Python with type information. Example:
```python
def f(ham:str , eggs:str  =  'eggs' )->str: 
    print( "Annotations from function:" , f . __annotations__ )
    return "1"

print( "Annotations outside function:" , f . __annotations__ )

f("1", "2")
```

## Function Decorators

A function definition may be wrapped by one or more decorator expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is defined, in the scope that contains the function definition. The result must be callable, which is invoked with the function object as the only argument. The returned value is bound to the function name instead of the function object. Multiple decorators are applied in a nested fashion. 

More information is available in [2]:
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-decorators.

For example, the following code will measure the time for function execution (it has been taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5478351/python-time-measure-function):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time   

def timing (f):
  def wrap(*args):
      time1 = time.time()
      ret = f(*args) 
      time2 = time.time()
      
      print ('{} function took {:.3f} ms'.format(f.__name__, (time2-time1) * 1000.0))           
      return ret     

  return wrap   

# Use Attributes
@timing 
def f1(seconds): 
  time.sleep(seconds)   

# Similar code without attributes
def f2(seconds):
  time.sleep(seconds)   

def f2_with_time(seconds):
  funcion_to_call = timing(f2)
  funcion_to_call(seconds)

f1(1.5)
f2_with_time(1.5)
```

This concept is called decorator because the intention of using it is to decorate function calls with specific pre/post-processing.

## Classes in Python

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. In C++ terminology the data members in Python are public, and all member functions are virtual and public. 

The method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. 

Like in C++, most built-in operators with special syntax can be redefined for class instances. Unlike C++ built-in types can be used as base classes for extension by the user:
```python
class A(int): pass
print(issubclass(A, int))
# Print: True
```

To inspect is the object is an instance of some class you can use [isinstance(obj, classinfo)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) which is analog of C++ [dynamic_cast](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dynamic_cast).

To inspect class relationships you can use [issubclass(classDerived, classBase)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#issubclass). This functionality is absent by design in C++. The C++ style says if you need it, you should implement it and pay for it with computing time and memory.


The [super()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) lets you avoid referring to the base class explicitly, which can be nice sometimes.

```python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

class Base:
  def f(self): print("Base")
  def fproxy(self): self.f() 

class DerivedA(Base):
  def f(self): print("DerivedA")

class DerivedB(Base):
  def f(self): print("DerivedB")


class DerivedAB(DerivedA, DerivedB):
  def f(self): 
      print("DerivedAB")
      Base.f(self)                 # Call Base explicitly
      super(DerivedAB, self).f()   # Call one of direct base with using super()
      DerivedB.f(self)             # Call DerivedB explicitly

obj = DerivedAB(time. Sleepxy()
```

## Magic Methods for Classes

Magic is an official term used by the Python community, even though in professional and science literature this term is used rarely. This informal name shines a light that a lot of things inside the Python community happen informally without any standardization. The effect that both styles (formal and informal) can coexist can be obtained by looking into API and development style for Android OS and Linux/Windows OS. The development for Android OS is mostly cowboy style.

A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax.
A complete list of these special methods is available in The Python Language Reference [2] https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names.

## Module Reloading

For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session.  If you change your modules source code you have two options on how to reload this module:

* Restart the interpreter
* Use [reload()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html?highlight=reload#imp.reload) function from [imp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html) module which provides access the import internals. Example: 
  ```python
  import imp
  imp.reload(module name)
  ```

## Encoding During Reading Files and With Statement

The text file is iterable and the content of the file is returned line by line. You can check the used *default* encoding for reading text files:
```python
import sys 
print(sys.getdefaultencoding())
```

If you want to open the file in the specified encoding you can specify this in [open()](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open).

To open and close files you can use open()/close() calls. 
One shorthand to automatize this operation is to use [with](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement) statement. With statement provides:
* The opening of the file 
* Closing in success/exception

Example:
```python
with open("my_file.txt", "rt") as f:
  for line in f:
      print(line)
```

The reason for closing files and closing existence in general is the following: Some objects contain references to external resources such as open files in the filesystem. These resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the external resource, usually with a `close()` method.

This design demonstrates that garbage collection is not a universal solution for all situations and all different types of resources.

## Defaultdict

[Defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) is a subclass (derived class) of the built-in [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=dict#dict) class. It can be found in the [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) module in the Python standard library.

 [Defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) is working mostly like a [std::map](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map) in C++. 

When the key is encountered for the first time and it is not already in the mapping then an entry value corresponding to the requested *key* is automatically created using the default_factory function and is instantiated.

Example:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

m1 = defaultdict(int) 
# default value will be an integer value of 0
m2 = defaultdict(str)
# default value will be an empty string ""
m3 = defaultdict(list)
# default value will be an empty list []
```

## Match Statement

A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. This is similar to a switch statement in C/C++ conceptually.

```python
 match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad Request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case _:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"
```

The variable name `_` acts as a wildcard and never fails to match, similar to `default:` in C/C++.

## Walrus

In Python, unlike C and C++, assignment inside expressions which is used in the conditional statement must be done explicitly with the walrus operator `:=`. It's the same as the operator `=` in C++ applied in the context of expression inside the `if` statement.

So the operator `:=` in Python can be used only in the context when you want to perform an assignment inside an expression that is used for conditions in the `if` statement.


```python
a=2
if a:=1:
  print(a)

# Output
# 1
```

## Generators

The class-based iterators is a functionality that is implemented via definition:
* `__iter__` method
* `__next__` method

See also [Interface and Protocols](#interfaces-and-protocols) in this document. What makes generators so compact is that the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods are created automatically.

Generators in Python are a specific type of function that uses the (`yield`) statement. Example:

```python
def one_two_three():
    x = 3
    yield x // 3
    x -= 2
    yield x + 1
    yield x * 3
        
for i in one_two_three():
    print(i)  # prints 1, 2, 3 in separate lines
```

The key feature of **generator** is that the local variables and execution state are automatically saved between calls. When generators terminate, they automatically raise [StopIteration](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html?highlight=stopiteration#StopIteration) exception.

The generators functionality does not return a value via [return](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=return#return) statement, instead, they send a value via [yield](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=return#grammar-token-python-grammar-yield_stmt) statement. See also: [link to generators](
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generators).

```python
def gen():     
    print ("Entry point in gen") # This will be executed only once, even a function yields several values
    yield 1 # emit value      
    yield 2 # emit one more value   

a = gen ()
print(next(a))   # use it to explicitly first yield statement
print(next(a))   # run to second yield statement, etc. 

# Next yield will throw a StopIteration exception    
```

## Package Managers

To have the ability to launch a project you need to install the needed libraries. Two standard way to install libraries for Python is `pip` and `conda` package managers. Conda has two goals:
  1. Conda is a package manager.
  2. Conda is an environment manager. 

The `pip` package manager is preinstalled with a Python interpreter. I prefer not to use pip directly, but instead use command for call pip directly from Python:
```python
python -m pip list
```
It's useful to eliminate problems with various installations of Python interpreters.

To install conda there are two ways: (1) Use Anaconda distribution containing Conda and other things; (2) Install Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

If you want to select (2) way then for example you can use the following command if you are using Linux distribution for x86-64 compute architecture:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
export PATH="${PATH}:~/miniconda3/bin"
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash && source ~/.bashrc && conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```
This code snippet has been taken from this OpenSource project: https://github.com/burlachenkok/flpytorch/tree/main.

## Environment Managers

Each project can have a specific requirement in a specific version of the library and this is the motivation behind the environment manager idea.

The venv module is a standard virtual environment in Python. In this section, we will compare venv with conda. If you want to obtain a list of available conda environments please use [conda info -e](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/main/commands/info.html).

|---|---------------|------------|------------------------|
| 1 |  conda create --name my	  |  python -m venv my	| Create an environment with the name "my" |
| 2 |  conda create --name my python==3.6.4 scikit-learn |  pip install	 | Create an environment with several packages in it|
| 3 |  conda activate my |  source ~/envs/my/bin/activate | Activate specific environment |
| 4 |  conda deactivate	|  source ~/envs/my/bin/deactivate	 | Deactivate environment |
| 5 |  conda list	|  pip freeze	 | Get List of installed packages in the current environment |

| 7|   conda env create --file myenv.yml | pip install -r requirements.txt | Install all packages from requirement list |
| 8 |  conda remove --name myenv --all	| Remove directory in filesystem with environment and it's scripts | Remove environment |

## Python Notebooks: General

Jupyter documentation is available here https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/. Jupyter Notebooks presents a way to create source code mixed with documentation in the form of Markdown. Also, Notebooks can serialize the results of numerical computation in the form of graphics into a single file.

Python Notebooks by itself does not provide means to debug Python Notebooks, however some IDE as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) support debugging of code inside Python Notebooks.

The following command will start the web server and open web-client:

```bash
python -m notebook
```

Start the web server and allow connection from outside (incoming connection from all network interfaces will be accepted):

```bash
python -m notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

> If you have problems with accessing the web server the first thing is to take a look if the port that you have specified listens to the port for incoming network connection. In Posix OS it can be done by using the [netstat](https://linux.die.net/man/8/netstat) command:
>  ```python
>  netstat -nap | grep -E "tcp(.)*LISTEN"
>  ```
> Please be aware that if the server is running on some machine it can be a case that the computer administrator blocks the ports. In Linux-based OS, by default, in most cases, people use iptables to configure acceptance of incoming connections. 
> The first thing you can try to execute from the root is the following command to allow all incoming connections from all interfaces:
> ```python
> iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT
> ```

Python notebook files extension is `*.ipynb`. The notebook contains code snippets and markdown text organized by cells. Cells roughly speaking can be of two types:

* Code
* Markdown

## Python Notebooks: Working in a web-based interface

| **Command**      | **Description** |
|---------------|------------|
| ALT+Enter          | Append cell (something like the section in Matlab)          |
| \$a_1+a_2\$     | It's possible to use Latex in Markdown         |
| \%matplotlib nbagg      | Append separate widget where output should be plotted          |
| \%matplotlib inline | Inline output into the notebook          |
| Left click on cell | Select to edit |
| Esc | Deselect for edit |
| Shift + down / Shift + up | Append cell to selection |
| Shift + Enter | Execute (selected) cell and go to next cell  |
| \%timeit | Built-in command in Jupyter does measure the time of command. [Documentation](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit).|
|  CTRL+M, B | Create code cell|
| CTRL+M, M	| Convert code cell to text cell |
| CTRL+M, Y | Convert text cell to code cell |
| %%bash; ls -1; lsb_release --all | Magic sequence to execute bash commands via `%%bash`. [Documentation](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-bash). |
| !pip install numpy | Magic command for executing bash command at code cell via using `!` mark. [Documentation](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/magics.html#magic-sx).|


Example of usage timeit inside code cells:
```python
%timeit for _ in range(10**3): True
```

## PyTorch Resources

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a big numerical package which most often used for the purpose of training Machine Learning models. However, it can be used in another situation as well:
* You have computations in [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and you want to port them to GPU
* You work in the domain when you have to deal with explicit mathematical functions. The function is pretty complex to compute partial derivatives explicitly.

In both cases [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) will help you.

## Matplotlib

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a plotting library. This section gives a brief introduction to the **`matplotlib.pyplot`** module, which provides a plotting system similar to  MATLAB. Documentation: http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html


### Plots
The most important function in matplotlib is **`plot`**, which allows you to plot 2D data. Here is a simple example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
x = np.arange(0 , 10 , 0.1)
y = np.sin(x) 
plt.plot(x, y)  
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

With a little extra work, we can easily plot multiple lines at once, and add a title, legend, and axis labels:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Plot the points using matplotlib
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.xlabel('x axis label')
plt.ylabel('y axis label')
plt.title('Sine and Cosine')
plt.legend(['Sine', 'Cosine'])
plt.show()
```

### Subplots
You can plot different things in the same figure using the **`subplot`** function. Here is an example:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves.
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Set up a subplot grid that has 2 rows and 1 column.
figure, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1)

# Make the first plot
ax = axes[0]  # plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
ax.plot(x, y_sin)
ax.set_title('Sine')

# Set the second subplot as active, and make the second plot.
ax = axes[1]  # plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
ax.plot(x, y_cos)
ax.grid(True)
ax.set_title('Cosine')

# Show the figure.
plt.show(figure)
```

### Show the image with Matplotlib

You can show the image with the following code snippet:
```python
import sys 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 
img = np.random.randint(low =  0, high =  255, size =  (16 ,  16,  3)) 
plt.imshow(img) 
plt.show()
```

Show sub-images:

```python
import sys 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 
out_arr = np.random.randint(low =  0, 
                            high = 255, 
                            size = (16, 16, 3))
plt.figure(figsize = (15 , 15)) 

for n in range(16):
  ax = plt.subplot( 4 , 5, n + 1 )
  ax.title.set_text( 'Plot #'  +  str ( n + 1 ) )     
  plt.imshow ( out_arr )  
  plt.axis( 'off' ) 
  plt.subplots_adjust (wspace = 0.01 , hspace = 0.1 )  

plt.show( )
```


## NumPy

[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the core library for scientific computing in Python.
It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. If you are already familiar with MATLAB, you might find [this tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) useful to get started with Numpy.

Check out the NumPy reference (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/) to find out much more about numpy beyond what is described below. You can find the full list of mathematical functions provided by numpy at: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html.

Numpy provides various functions for manipulating arrays; you can see the full list at: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.array-manipulation.html.

Broadcasting explanation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html.

(If you think that Broadcasting is an incorrect thing to be designed in the first place - you are not alone).

To use the `numpy` library in your project you need to:
* Install it with your package manager via `pip install numpy`
* Import numpy via `import numpy as np`

### Arrays
A numpy array is a grid of values, **all of the same type**, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers.  The number of dimensions is the rank of the array. The shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension. 
* Rank of the array - is a number of dimensions.
* Tensor (in Machine Learning / Deep Learning) - is a name used to describe multidimensional arrays.
* Shape - description of dimensions for a multidimensional array organized as a tuple. Each dimension of a multi-dimensional array is called a "dimension" or "axe".

We can initialize numpy arrays from nested Python lists, and access elements using square brackets:
```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])   # Create a rank 1 array
print(type(a))            # Prints "<class 'numpy.ndarray'>"
print(a.shape)            # Prints "(3,)"
print(a[0], a[1], a[2])   # Prints "1 2 3"
a[0] = 5                  # Change an element of the array
print(a)                  # Prints "[5, 2, 3]"

b = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])    # Create a rank 2 array
print(b.shape)                     # Prints "(2, 3)"
print(b[0, 0], b[0, 1], b[1, 0])   # Prints "1 2 4"
```

Numpy provides many functions to create arrays:

```python
a = np.zeros((2,2))   # Create an array of all zeros with shape 2x2
print(a)              # Prints "[[ 0.  0.]
                      #          [ 0.  0.]]"

b = np.ones((1,2))    # Create an array of all ones
print(b)              # Prints "[[ 1.  1.]]"

c = np.full((2,2), 7)  # Create a constant array
print(c)               # Prints "[[ 7.  7.]
                       #          [ 7.  7.]]"

d = np.eye(2)         # Create a 2x2 identity matrix
print(d)              # Prints "[[ 1.  0.]
                      #          [ 0.  1.]]"

e = np.random.random((2,2))  # Create an array filled with random values
print(e)                     # Might print "[[ 0.42  0.42]
                             #               [ 0.42  0.42]]"
  
f = np.arange(5)             # Create an array with the values from 0 to 4
print(f)                     # Prints "[0 1 2 3 4]"

g = np.arange(4.2, 7.1, 0.5)  # Create an array with the values from 4.2 to 
                              # 7.1 on steps of 0.5
print(g)                      # Prints "[4.2 4.7 5.2 5.7 6.2 6.7]"

h = np.linspace(10, 20, 5)  # Create an array with 5 equally spaced values 
                            # between 10 and 20
print(h)                    # Prints "[[10. 12.5 15. 17.5 20.]"
```

### Array Indexing

Numpy offers several ways to index into arrays. Similar to Python lists, numpy arrays can be sliced. Since arrays may be multidimensional, you must specify a slice for each dimension of the array. Example:

```python
# Create the following rank 2 array with shape (3, 4)
# [[ 1  2  3  4]
#  [ 5  6  7  8]
#  [ 9 10 11 12]]
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], 
              [5,6,7,8], 
              [9,10,11,12]])

# Use slicing to pull out the subarray consisting of the first 2 rows
# and columns 1 and 2 (and not 3); b is the following array of shape (2, 2):
# [[2 3]
#  [6 7]]
b = a[:2, 1:3]
print(b)

# A slice of an array is a view into the same data, so modifying it
# will modify the original array.

print(a[0, 1])   # Prints "2"
b[0, 0] = 77     # b[0, 0] is the same piece of data as a[0, 1]
print(a[0, 1])   # Prints "77"
print(b)
```

You can also mix integer indexing with slice indexing. However, doing so will yield an array of lower ranks than the original array:

```python
# Create the following rank 2 arrays with shapes (3, 4)
# [[ 1  2  3  4]
#  [ 5  6  7  8]
#  [ 9 10 11 12]]
a = np.array([[1,2,3,4], 
              [5,6,7,8], 
              [9,10,11,12]])

# Two ways of accessing the data in the middle row of the array.

# Mixing integer indexing with slices yields an array of lower ranks,
# while using only slices yields an array of the same rank as the
# original array:
row_r1 = a[1, :]    # Rank 1 view of the second row of a
row_r2 = a[1:2, :]  # Rank 2 view of the second row of a
print(row_r1, row_r1.shape)  # Prints "[5 6 7 8] (4,)"
print(row_r2, row_r2.shape)  # Prints "[[5 6 7 8]] (1, 4)"

# We can make the same distinction when accessing columns of an array:
col_r1 = a[:, 1]
col_r2 = a[:, 1:2]

print(col_r1, col_r1.shape)  # Prints "[ 2  6 10] (3,)"

print(col_r2, col_r2.shape)  # Prints "[[ 2]
                             #          [ 6]
                             #          [10]] (3, 1)"
```


The ellipsis is used in NumPy to slice higher-dimensional data structures. It's designed to mean at this point, insert as many full slices (`:`) to extend the multi-dimensional slice to all dimensions.

```python
a = np.array ([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
b = a [...]
b[0,0]=11
print(a == b)
```

Also, you can put, the new axis to increase the dimension of the existing array by one more dimension when used once. 
```python
import numpy as np
a = np.array ([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
b = a [..., np.newaxis]
print(b.shapea)
```

### Boolean Array Indexing

 Boolean array indexing lets you pick out arbitrary elements of an array. Frequently this type of indexing is used to select the elements of an array that satisfy some condition. Here is an example:

```python
a = np.array([[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

bool_idx = (a > 2)   # Find the elements of a that are bigger than 2;
                     # This returns a numpy array of Booleans of the same
                     # shape as a, where each slot of bool_idx tells
                     # whether that element of a is > 2.

print(bool_idx)      # Prints "[[False False]
                     #          [ True  True]
                     #          [ True  True]]"

# We use boolean array indexing to construct a rank 1 array
# consisting of the elements of corresponding to the True values
# of bool_idx
print(a[bool_idx])  # Prints "[3 4 5 6]"

# We can do all of the above in a single concise statement:
print(a[a > 2])     # Prints "[3 4 5 6]"
```

### Datatypes

Every numpy array is a grid of elements of the same type. Numpy provides a large set of numeric datatypes that you can use to construct arrays. Numpy tries to guess a datatype when you create an array, but functions that construct arrays usually also include an optional argument to explicitly specify the datatype. Here is an example:

```python
x = np.array([1, 2])       # Let numpy choose the datatype
print(x.dtype)             # Prints "int64"
x = np.array([1.0, 2.0])   # Let numpy choose the datatype
print(x.dtype)             # Prints "float64"

x = np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int64)   # Force a particular datatype
print(x.dtype)                         # Prints "int64"
```

### Array Math

Basic mathematical functions operate elementwise on arrays, and are available both as operator overloads and as functions in the numpy module:

```python
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]], dtype=np.float64)
y = np.array([[5,6],[7,8]], dtype=np.float64)

# Elementwise sum; both produce the array
# [[ 6.0  8.0]
#  [10.0 12.0]]
print(x + y)
print(np.add(x, y))

# Elementwise difference; both produce the array
# [[-4.0 -4.0]
#  [-4.0 -4.0]]
print(x - y)
print(np.subtract(x, y))

# Elementwise product; both produce the array
# [[ 5.0 12.0]
#  [21.0 32.0]]
print(x * y)
print(np.multiply(x, y))

# Elementwise division; both produce the array
# [[ 0.2         0.33333333]
#  [ 0.42857143  0.5       ]]
print(x / y)
print(np.divide(x, y))

# Elementwise square root; produces the array
# [[ 1.          1.41421356]
#  [ 1.73205081  2.        ]]
print(np.sqrt(x))
print(x**0.5)
```

### Important Notice About the Syntax for Matrix Multiplication

Note that unlike MATLAB, **`*`** is elementwise multiplication, not matrix multiplication. 

In numpy instead of using `*` you need to use the **`dot`** function or operator **`@`** to compute inner products of vectors, to multiply a vector by a matrix, and to multiply matrices. **`dot`** is available both as a function in the numpy module and as an instance method of array objects:

```python
x = np.array([[1,2],
              [3,4]])
y = np.array([[5,6],
              [7,8]])

v = np.array([9,10])
w = np.array([11, 12])

# Inner product of vectors
print(v.dot(w))
print(np.dot(v, w))
print(v @ w)

# Matrix/vector product; both produce the rank 1 array [29 67]
print(x.dot(v))
print(np.dot(x, v))
print(x @ v)

# Matrix/matrix product; both produce the rank 2 array
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]
print(x.dot(y))
print(np.dot(x, y))
print(x@y)
```

### Utility Functions in NumPy

Numpy provides many useful functions for performing computations on arrays; one of the most useful is **`sum`**:
```python
x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

print(np.sum(x))          # Compute sum of all elements; prints "10"
print(np.sum(x, axis=0))  # Compute sum of each column; prints "[4 6]"
print(np.sum(x, axis=1))  # Compute sum of each row; prints "[3 7]"
```

Apart from computing mathematical functions using arrays, we frequently need to reshape or otherwise manipulate data in arrays. The simplest example of this type of operation is transposing a matrix. To transpose a matrix, simply use the **`T`** attribute of an array object:

```python
x = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
print(x)    # Prints "[[1 2]
            #          [3 4]]"
print(x.T)  # Prints "[[1 3]
            #          [2 4]]"

# Note that taking the transpose of a rank 1 array does nothing:
v = np.array([1,2,3])
print(v)    # Prints "[1 2 3]"
print(v.T)  # Prints "[1 2 3]"
```

For reshaping the matrix into different forms, you can use the reshaping function **`np.reshape`**:

```python
x = np.arange(12)
y = x.reshape((3,4))

print(x)    # Prints "[ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11]"
print(y)    # Prints "[[ 0  1  2  3]
            #          [ 4  5  6  7]
            #          [ 8  9 10 11]]"
```

### Broadcasting

Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows numpy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations. Frequently we have a smaller array and a larger array, and we want to use the smaller array multiple times to perform some operation on the larger array. Unfortunately in practice that mechanism can lead to confusion. So be very careful!

Example: Add a constant vector to each row of a matrix. 

```python
# We will add the vector v to each row of the matrix x,
# storing the result in the matrix y
x = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12]])
v = np.array([1, 0, 1])

#=========================================================================
# Add the vector v to each row of the matrix x with an explicit loop
#=========================================================================
y = np.empty_like(x)   # Create an empty matrix with the same shape as x
for i in range(4):
    y[i, :] = x[i, :] + v

# Now y is the following
# [[ 2  2  4]
#  [ 5  5  7]
#  [ 8  8 10]
#  [11 11 13]]
print(y)

#=========================================================================
# Add the vector with tiling
#=========================================================================

vv = np.tile(v, (4, 1))   # Stack 4 copies of v on top of each other
print(vv)                 # Prints "[[1 0 1]
                          #          [1 0 1]
                          #          [1 0 1]
                          #          [1 0 1]]"
y = x + vv  # Add x and vv elementwise
print(y)  # Prints "[[ 2  2  4
          #          [ 5  5  7]
          #          [ 8  8 10]
          #          [11 11 13]]"
            

#=========================================================================
# Add vector with broadcasting
#=========================================================================
# Numpy broadcasting allows us to perform computation without actually creating multiple copies of **`v`**. 
# Consider this version, using broadcasting.
# We will add the vector v to each row of the matrix x,
# storing the result in the matrix y

v = np.array([1, 0, 1])
y = x + v  # Add v to each row of x using broadcasting
print(y)  # Prints "[[ 2  2  4]
          #          [ 5  5  7]
          #          [ 8  8 10]
          #          [11 11 13]]"
            
```

Broadcasting two arrays together follows these rules:

1. If the arrays do not have the same rank, prepend the shape of the lower rank array with 1s until both shapes have the same length.
2. The two arrays are said to be compatible in a dimension if they have the same size in the dimension, or if one of the arrays has size 1 in that dimension.
3. The arrays can be broadcast together if they are compatible in all dimensions.
4. After broadcasting, each array behaves as if it had a shape equal to the elementwise maximum of shapes of the two input arrays.
5. In any dimension where one array had size 1 and the other array had a size greater than 1, the first array behaves as if it were copied along that dimension


# Appendix

## Cython

[Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is Python with C data types. Official documentation: https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

Cython has two major use cases: 
1. Extending the CPython interpreter with fast binary modules.
2. Interfacing Python code with external C libraries.

Almost any piece of Python code is also valid Cython code. Usually, the speedups are between **2x** to **1000x**. It depends on how much you use the Python interpreter compared to situations where your code is in C/C++ Libraries.

There are two file types for Cython:
* `*.pyx` - something similar to C/C++ source files.
* `*.pxd` - something similar to C-header files. PXD files are imported into PYX files with the `cimport` keyword.

The files in Cython have several functions inside them:
* `def-functions` - Python functions are defined using the def statement, as in Python. Only Python functions can be called from this function.

* `cdef-functions` - C functions are defined using the new compare to Python `cdef` statement. Within a Cython module, Python functions and C functions can call each other.

* `cpdef-functions` - is a hybrid of `cdef` and `def`. It uses the faster C calling conventions when being called from other Cython codes and uses a Python interpreter when they are called from Python. Essentially it will create a C function and a wrapper for Python.


During passing argument from `cdef` to `def` functions and vice versa there is an automatic type casting occurs:
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#automatic-type-conversions

### How to optimize Python Code with Cython

0. Install Cython for your Python interpreter: `python -m pip install Cython`.

1. The first step is to take the usual Python file "*.py" and change the extension to "*.pyx".

2. The second and most powerful step that can be used now while using Cython is to append type information to variables. In practice especially if you are using loops it brings good speedup immediately. Examples:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    cdef int x,y,z
    cdef char *s
    cdef float f1 = 5.2    # single precision
    cdef double f2 = 40.5  # double precision
    cdef list languages
    cdef dict abc_dict
    cdef object thing
    ```

3. Next step you can append extra modifiers to functions. Example:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    
    # Can not be called from Python
    cdef sumCDef(): 
      cdef int i
      cdef int s = 0
      for i in range(10):
        s += i
      return s
    
    # Can be called from Python and Cython
    def sumDef(): 
      cdef int i
      cdef int s = 0
      for i in range(10):
        s += i
      return s
    
    # Can be called from Python and Cython effectively
    cpdef sumCpDef(): 
      cdef int i
      cdef int s = 0
      for i in range(10):
        s += i
      return s
    ```

4. The Next Step is to build your code because Cython is not an interpretable Python language extension. The script that describes that you want to build all *.pyx files in the current directory, which is typically used for projects that use Cython:
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # filename: setup.py
    # pip install Cython
    from setuptools import setup
    from Cython.Build import cythonize
    setup(
        name        = 'Test',
        ext_modules = cythonize("*.pyx"),
        zip_safe    = False,
    )
    ```
5. Launch the build process from the previous description:
    ```bash
    python build.py build_ext --in place
    ```
    The output of this command is
    * `*.so` in Unix-like OS.
    * `*.pyd` in Windows.

6. If the build process was successful then to import your module into the Python interpreter you can use the usual `import` statement:
    ```python
    import my_module
    ```

### About Cython Language

The `cdef`  statement is used to declare C variables, either in the local function scope or at the module level:
```python
cdef int i, j, k
```

With cdef, you can declare `struct`, `union`, `enum`
(See [Cython documentation](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#structs-unions-enums))
:
```python
cdef struct Grail:     
  int age     
  float volume
```

You can use `ctypedef` as an equivalent for C/C++ typedef:
```
ctypedef unsigned long ULong
```

It's possible to declare functions with cdef, making them C functions:
```python
cdef int eggs(unsigned long l, float f)
```

References with further details:
* https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-and-basics-cython-tutorial

### Easy Interoperability with Standard C Library
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

cdef extern from "math.h":     
    double sin(double x)

from libc.math cimport sin
from cpython.version cimport PY_VERSION_HEX

cpdef double f(double x):     
  print("CPython version for which code is compiled:", 
        PY_VERSION_HEX)
  return sin(x * x)
```

External declaration in form `cdef extern from "math.h":     double sin(double x)` declares the `sin()` function in a way that makes it available to Cython code. It instructs Cython to generate C code that includes the `math.h` header file. 

The C compiler will see the original declaration in math.h at compile time. Importantly Cython does not parse "math.h" and requires a separate definition in such form.

It is possible to declare and call into any C library as long as the module that Cython generates is properly linked against the shared or static library.

### Example of Function Integration in Cython and Python
```
# Source File: integration.pyx 
# Depencies:
#  python -m pip install cython

import time

def timing(f):
    def wrap(*args):
        time1 = time.time()
        ret = f(*args)
        time2 = time.time()
        print('{:s} function took {:.3f} ms'.format(f.__name__, (time2-time1)*1000.0))
        return ret   
    return wrap  

def f(double x):     
    return x ** 2 - x  

@timing 
def integrate_f(double a, double b, int N):  
    cdef int i     
    cdef double s, dx

    s = 0    
    dx = (b - a) / N  
    for i in range(N):
        s += f(a + i * dx)
    return s * dx  

@timing 
def integrate_f_std(a, b, N):     
    s = 0     
    dx = (b - a) / N   
    for i in range(N):    
        s += f(a + i * dx)  
    return s * dx

# Build with:
#   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#
# Where setup.py:
#  from setuptools import setup
#  from Cython.Build import cythonize
#  setup(
#     name        = 'Reduction Test',
#      ext_modules = cythonize("*.pyx"),
#      zip_safe    = False,
#    )

# Use from Python after build:
#   import integration
#   integration.intergrate_f(0.0,100.0,1000)
#   integration.integrate_f_std(0.0,100.0,1000)
```

## Python Profiling

### Profiling Python Code with Python Tools

Python interpreter has built-in profiling tools: [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile) and [profile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile). Invocation of these profiling tools for your code snippet can be done in the following way. Example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Source: sum_with_numpy.py
import numpy as np

for i in range(10000):
    z = np.arange(100000).sum()
```

To launch the Python profile you should invoke the following:
```bash
python -m cProfile sum_with_numpy.py 
```
or
```bash
python -m profile sum_with_numpy.py 
```
Information about text report format which is dumped into standard output can be read from [python profile module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-profile) documentation. The main values are the following:

* **ncalls** - the number of calls.
* **tottime** -  the total time spent in the given function, excluding time made in calls to sub-functions.
* **cumtime** - is the cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions

For most use cases the most prevalent way to measure performance is using the [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile) module.

Another built-in tool for profiling small code snippets from Python interpreters is [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html). It can be invoked like this and used for measuring the time for execution of Python statement from several repeating trials:
```bash
python -m timeit --number 200 --setup "" --unit=sec "'-'.join([str(n) for n in range(1)])"
```

The timeit can be used not only as a separate tool, but can be used inside the Python code itself:

```python
import timeit
#....
timeit.timeit("'-'.join([str(n) for n in range(1)])", setup="", number=1000000)
```

### Profiling with Tools Available in Operation System: Windows OS

From the perspective of Operation System (OS) the Python Process is just a program operating in userspace. In modern OS the processes can not issue direct requests to BIOS and all communication with OS happens via System Calls. So even though your program is not built from some source code:
* You are using precompiled/prebuilt version of the Python interpreter
* You are using precompiled/prebuilt version of dynamic libraries distributed with packages
* You have also the source code of your Pyhon program that is interpreted by the interpreter on the fly.

To get a general picture into executed Python process with your scripts - one way is to observe it from system calls characteristics. To take hands-on experience and also analyze overheads from Python, for example, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# filename: test.py

import numpy as np
import time

s = time.time()
for i in range(10000):
    z = np.arange(100000).sum()
    if i == 10000-1:
        print("Sum: ", z)
e = time.time()
print("Elapsed Time: ", (e-s)*1000, "milliseconds")

input()
```

Hot to run:
```bash
python3 test.py
```

For comparison, you can create equivalent code in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <iterator>
// #include <windows.h>

namespace chrono = std::chrono;

int main()
{
    auto start = chrono::steady_clock::now();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 10000; ++i)
    {       
        int32_t sum = 0;
        for (int32_t j = 0; j < 100000; ++j)
            sum += j;

        if (i == 10000 -1)
            std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << "\n";
    }
    auto end = chrono::steady_clock::now();

    std::cout << "Eclapsed Time: " << chrono::duration_cast<chrono::milliseconds>(end - start).count() << " milliseconds\n";
    
    //void * pp =VirtualAlloc(0, 1024 * 1024 * 100, MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
    //void* pp2 = VirtualAlloc(0, 1024 * 1024 * 400, MEM_RESERVE|MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);

    getchar();
    return 0;
}
```

```bash

At the end of scipt, there is an `input()` which will wait for input, and similar to C++ code there is a blocking for waiting input from stdin and processes will be alive. For Windows OS collecting a large number of counters is possible via the [SysInternals Suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/) created by [Mark Russinovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich):

* [Process Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) will allow you to collect statistics and exact systems calls that process (such as `python.exe`) did with Files, Registry, Network, Load Dynamic Libraries. It also allows us to inspect how long call stacks are and inspect during the timeline of execution where there is a bottleneck - I/O, Memory, and CPU Computing.

* [Process Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer). It allows inspecting the name of files that are currently open to specific processes (such as `python.exe`) and, a list of dynamic libraries (`.dll`) mapped into virtual images of process (such as `python.exe`).

* [VMMap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/vmmap). It demonstrates a process of virtual memory map.

* [RAMMap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/RAMMap). It demonstrates a distribution of physical DRAM memory among parts in Windows OS.

Please be aware. Even though these tools have a nice GUI interface, using them if you have a lack of Operation Systems background may not be easy at the beginning. These tools are powerful profiling/inspection tools that can be used to find malware software in the OS. If you have never heard about these tools, please take a look at some talk by [Mark Rusinovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Russinovich). E.g. [License to Kill: Malware Hunting with the SysInternals Tools
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_TPZxuTzBU&ab_channel=MarkRussinovich). 

Python is used also by people without a CS background but with another background (biology, chemistry, etc.). Terminology used in these tools has a OS system flavor. And below we will present some terminology used in these tools:

>
> **User Space Time** - your Python interpreter, is not one thing inside Windows OS (press CTRL+Esc and you will see it). User space-time is the time that your process (python.exe) has spent in userspace. This time excludes the time that the system spends on another process.
>
> **Kernel Space Time** - your Python interpreter and any program will request OS to open the file. After the moment you have initialized the System Call and you form the request to OS (in fact I/O Dispatcher) you execution thread that executes code inside Python interpreter, compiled C libraries will be blocked and will be sleep. In this moment on behalf of this thread, the OS will spend time executing logic inside the kernel. At least some operations that OS did on behalf of your thread after I/O Dispatching to correct the Driver will take some time. This time is Kernel Space-Time.
>
> **Working Set** - *working set* or *pinned memory* or *non-paged memory* is the same concept which means that memory.
>
> **Virtual Memory** - It is a concept that separates a program's view of memory from the system's physical memory. In general, It is an operating system that decides when to store the program's code and data in physical memory and when to store it in some file.
>
> **Commit Memory** - Almost always the tools from SysInternals report the Committed Virtual Memory that your process has requested. The *commit limit* is the sum of physical memory and the sizes of the paging files used for backing up your data. In Windows OS there is another type of memory *"reserved virtual memory"*, which is a memory address reserved by the application, but the application does not (and ca not) use it, until memory is committed. When a process commits a region of virtual memory, the operating system guarantees that it can maintain all the data the process stores in the memory either in physical memory or on disk.
>
> **Physical Memory** - The installed physical memory in the computer by the Windows memory manager populates memory with the code and data from all processes, device drivers, and the OS. The amount of memory can affect performance, because when data or code a process or the operating system needs is not present, the memory manager must bring it in from disk. 
>
> **System Virtual Memory Limit** -  the sum of roughly the size of physical memory plus the maximum configured size of any paging files.
>
> **Nonpaged Memory (Kernel) Pool** - authors of drivers for Windows OS have two options for where to allocate memory. One of these resources is a nonpaged memory pool. The OS kernel and drivers use a nonpaged pool to store data that might be accessed when the system can't handle page faults. 
The kernel enters such a state when it executes interrupt service routines (ISRs) and deferred procedure calls (DPCs). A nonpaged pool is always kept present in physical memory. Information About this value can be obtained from Process Explorer->System Information->Memory".
>
> **Paged (Kernel) Pool** - Paged pool is used by OS and device drivers to situation when can store data that is backed in the paging file, and not necessarily presented in physical memory. Information About this value can be obtained from Process Explorer->System Information->Memory".
